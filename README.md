📌 Heart Disease Analysis – Data Science Project

This project analyzes a synthetic heart disease dataset of 50,000 patients with 20 clinical, demographic, lifestyle, and historical features.
The goal is to identify the most important factors associated with heart disease and build a predictive modeling pipeline.

🚀 Key Features of This Project
✔ Data Cleaning

-Dropped Alcohol_Intake (fully missing)

-Filled missing values in Physical_Activity

-Verified data types and corrected inconsistencies

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis

-Histograms of all key features

-Heart disease distribution

-Age vs Cholesterol visualization

-Cholesterol distribution by disease

-Correlation heatmap

-Composite risk score analysis

✔ Major Insights

-Heart disease prevalence: 46.35%

Strongest correlations:

    -Hypertension (0.40)

    -Age (0.38)

    -Cholesterol_Total (0.37)

    -Diabetes (0.34)

    -Previous_Heart_Attack (0.24)

-Cholesterol levels significantly higher in diseased group

-Systolic BP not strongly discriminative
